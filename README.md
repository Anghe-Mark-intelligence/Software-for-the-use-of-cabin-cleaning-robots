During the process of loading and unloading goods at sea, clearing the cargo hold of general cargo ships is a major challenge for crew members. Under a tight schedule and heavy workload, crew members often need to work day and night in reverse to complete cabin cleaning and unloading work. Sometimes, they may even be unable to complete unloading and cleaning in a timely manner. For example, if the two ends of the journey are too close, and the previous section is loaded with coal while the next section is loaded with grain (coal to grain), the cabin needs to be cleaned to meet the standard of being able to load grain. However, due to the short distance of the journey, timely cleaning is not possible, resulting in huge economic losses. At this time, ship cleaning robots that utilize artificial intelligence technology have emerged. The government has issued relevant technical standards, including the "Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Marine Environmental Pollution from Ships" and the "Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Marine Environmental Pollution from Ships and Their Related Operations in the People's Republic of China", which stipulate the requirements for the design, manufacturing, installation, and other aspects of ship cleaning robots to ensure that they meet safety, stability, and efficiency standards.
In the past, the cleaning work inside ships usually required a large amount of manpower investment, and due to the small space and complex environment inside ships, the cleaning work was difficult. Therefore, the emergence of multifunctional cabin cleaning robots has brought revolutionary changes to ship cleaning. These robots can automatically clean the interior of the cabin, not only improving cleaning efficiency, but also reducing labor costs and improving work safety. With the development of the shipping industry and the increasing demand for ship cleanliness and hygiene, the market demand for multifunctional cleaning robots is also gradually increasing.

Taking our developed robot as an example, compared to ordinary AGV chassis, it is equipped with a bucket for gathering bulk cargo. After most of the cargo is unloaded from the ship, the remaining scattered cargo is difficult to unload directly using a grab bucket. Therefore, it is necessary to collect the cargo in the cargo hold and stack it up. The traditional method requires manual operation of a shovel. Then, use a grab bucket to grab and unload the goods. The cargo hold of a ship is very large and requires a lot of manpower. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence and robotics technology can effectively solve this problem. After most of the goods are unloaded, the robot can stack them up for easy unloading. The robot achieves this goal through a flexible steering chassis, automatic obstacle avoidance function, and emergency stop function. The emergency stop function refers to the emergency stop function when the radar recognizes the distance to the surrounding cabin walls and acts as a safety function before the collision. Firstly, the automatic obstacle avoidance function and emergency stop function ensure that the robot will not collide with the bulkheads of bulk carriers, causing structural damage to the bulkheads. The fully steering chassis can move flexibly at the bottom of the cargo hold, gathering cargo in the middle of the hold according to the preset route plan, making it easy for the grab bucket to unload cargo. The cargo hold structure of bulk carriers is complex, high, and sometimes toxic gases may exist. For example, when transporting coal, coal may emit carbon monoxide due to insufficient oxygen, and when transporting grain, it may be affected by
The release of ammonia gas from damp or moldy grains is very dangerous for crew members. Our multifunctional robots can replace crew members to perform these dangerous tasks. Overall, the application of artificial intelligence and robotics technology in the field of automatic sorting and cleaning of ships can provide crew members with sufficient rest, ensure navigation safety, and reduce the labor required for this important task, allowing crew members to focus more on other tasks.
In the process of using robots, there are many areas that require collaboration when using ROS (Robot Operating System) in Linux systems. It takes a lot of time to boot up or make adaptive changes to the environment. Therefore, we plan to create a multifunctional integrated Python system - an integrated control system for cleaning robots. The robot uses our self created EKF SLAM (Enhanced Kalman Filter Synchronous Mapping and Localization Algorithm) for path planning and accuracy testing and collection in different spaces. The SSH function is required to connect the personal laptop with the robot's main control board (NUC), and other functions will be described in Chapter 2.
